		(rules "The board starts with 5 red marbles forming a pyramid in the middle of the board. Starting with white, each player places a marble on an empty space or platform (2x2 arrangement of marbles). A player may also pass if the other player didn't pass on his turn. White wins by forming a chain of touching marbles connecting the east and the west side. Black wins by connecting the south and the north side.")
