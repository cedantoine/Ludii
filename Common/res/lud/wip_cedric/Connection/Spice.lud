		(description "Spice is a short game for two players. Spice is a very simple adaptation of Ketchup for play with the Series: Shibumi game system.")
		(rules "In Spice, the goal is to have the largest group of stones when the game is complete. A group is defined as stones that are \"touching\", either orthogonally or one on top of the other. The game is over when all the spaces on the gameboard have been filled. Players play with either White or black stones, and the game begins with a small red 5-stone 2x2 pyramid in the center of the gameboard. The red stones cannot be removed and are neutral, they do not count toward either player's groups of stones. On the first turn of the game, White must place 1 white stone in any empty space. On subsequent turns, players put 1 or 2 stones of their color in any empty space on the board. If the largest group of stones on the board after your turn is larger than the largest group of stones (of either color) before your turn, then your opponent may remove one of your \"free\" stones on their next turn (and only on their next turn). The game ends immediately when the board is full, but the top stone is removed before scoring.")
