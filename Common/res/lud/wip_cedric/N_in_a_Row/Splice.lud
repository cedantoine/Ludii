		(rules "The board starts empty. Players take turns placing either: a ball of their colour on any hole or any platform that contains at least one red ball, or a red ball on any hole or any platform. A player wins by making a flat line spanning side to side, or corner to corner, on any level, composed entirely of friendly and neutral balls (at least one of each). If the placement of a red ball achieves this for both players, then the mover wins.")
