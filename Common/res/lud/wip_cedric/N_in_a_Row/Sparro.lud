		(rules "Start with five neutral balls filling the interior points. Players start with 12 balls of their colour. Players take turns placing a ball of their colour at any playable point. If the first move is to a corner hole then the second move must be to a non-corner hole, and vice versa. The game ends when all 24 balls have been played. The player with the most lines of size 3 in their colour wins. If tied, the last player to make a line of size 3 wins, otherwise Black wins.")
