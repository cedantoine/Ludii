        (description "Spline+ was evolved from Spline by adding ball movement. It's a ball-stacking game that can be played with a Series: Shibumi set.")
        (rules "The board starts empty. Starting with white, players take turns either: placing a ball of their colour on an empty space or platform (2×2 arrangement of marbles) or moving a movable ball of their colour already on the board to another valid location. If supported balls drop as a consequence of the ball removal, you can't place your ball on top of the dropped balls. Movable balls are balls that are not pinned. A pinned ball is a ball that supports 2 or more balls on the level above.")
