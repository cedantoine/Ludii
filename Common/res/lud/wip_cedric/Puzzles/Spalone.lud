        (rules "The player puts 10 balls of each colour (red, white, black) in a bag, then randomly draws a ball each turn and places it either: 1. on an empty board hole, or: 2. on a 2x2 platform that contains at least two balls of the same colour. The puzzle ends when the player cannot place the ball just drawn. It is solved if the player can place the last ball on the apex of the pyramid. The random draw means that not all games will be solvable - some patience may be required! We do not yet know exactly how much patience.")
