		(rules "Start: The board starts empty. Play: Players take turns either adding or moving a ball of their colour to any playable point. Balls cannot be moved onto any ball that dropped as a result of the move. End: A player wins by placing balls of their colour at the five corners of a pyramid of any size, pointing up or down. If pyramids of both colours are formed then the mover wins.")
