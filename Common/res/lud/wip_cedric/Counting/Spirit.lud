        (rules "Each player has an allocated colour, and they take turns during the game (white -> black -> red). On your turn, place one of your balls on an empty hole or platform so that no other FREE ball (no balls on top) of the SAME colour is on the same row or column of the same level^. If you can't, then you must pass. If all players pass in a single round the game ends. The player with most balls on the board wins.")
