			(rules "The board starts empty. Players take turns placing two balls at any playable points. Each ball must be either the mover's colour or red. On the first move only, White must play an additional third (red) ball. As each ball is played, its score is counted. A ball of the mover's colour scores points equal to the number of red balls that it touches. A red ball scores a number of points equal to the number of balls of the mover's colour it touches. Relative scoring is used. One player's score will be 0, while the other player's score will be the number of points ahead they are. The game ends when the pyramid is completed, and is won by the player with points above 0.")
