The balls can be placed on board holes or on top of 2x2 platforms of existing balls. You can place a ball on a hole and the other on a platform, as long as they touch each other. When the pyramid is complete, the player with the most visible balls in a column (from bottom to left side) wins that column. The winner is the player who has won at least 3 columns.")
